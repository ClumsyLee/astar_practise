Homework that practise A* algorithm learned in class

# Notice
This is a project created by a student, who is still learning C++, and using it as a practise.  
Also, it is actually a homework assigned in class.  
So, if you find any mistake, take it easy...remember I'm just a beginer in C++ (as well as other languages)
